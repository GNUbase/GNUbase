# MCP server

GNUbase has a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so AI agents such as Claude Code can use everything the engine can do: create projects, add tracks and notes, play, render and measure audio, and run Lua.

- **Tools come from the engine's command registry.** Every engine command is a tool, named with `_` instead of `.` (`track.add` is `track_add`), with the command's parameter schema as its input schema and its result schema as its output schema. A command that only reads is marked read-only (`readOnlyHint`). The [tool catalogue](#tool-catalogue) at the end lists them all; the registry itself is `engine_commands`.
- **`script_run`** runs Lua code with the same API ([lua.md](lua.md)) in a sandbox, for work that takes many steps or for test cases written with `gnubase.test`.
- **Events:** `events_take` returns what changed in the engine since the last call, such as `track.added` or `history.changed`, whoever changed it: this client, other MCP clients, Lua scripts or the UI. See [Events](#events).
- **Resources:** queries without required parameters can also be read as resources, `gnubase://<command>`, e.g. `gnubase://project.get`.
- **Errors:** a command that fails is a tool result with `isError: true` and the reason, such as `parameters.type must be one of [...]`, so the agent can correct itself. Malformed messages get JSON-RPC errors.
- The server speaks MCP revision 2025-06-18; HTTP clients may also send `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-03-26`.

How it fits into GNUbase is described in [architecture.md](architecture.md#scripting-mcp-and-tests).

## Starting the server

GNUbase serves MCP in headless mode, without UI. The engine plays through the dummy audio device, which has no hardware and captures its output in memory, so agents can render audio offline and measure it.

**stdio** (the default): the MCP client starts GNUbase and talks to it over stdin and stdout, one JSON-RPC message per line. GNUbase stops when stdin ends.

```bash
gnubase --headless
gnubase --headless --project song.dawproject --sample-rate 44100 --block-size 128
```

Stdout belongs to MCP. Messages for people go to stderr and to the log file `gnubase-headless.log` in the per-user log folder.

**HTTP**: GNUbase runs on its own and clients connect to it on this machine. It prints the URL and a new access token, and serves until Ctrl+C or SIGTERM.

```bash
gnubase --headless --mcp-http          # a free port
gnubase --headless --mcp-http=8765     # a fixed port
```

```text
MCP server: http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
Access token: 3f1c...e9a0
```

Clients send each message with `POST /mcp` and the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Answers are JSON; notifications get `202 Accepted`. `initialize` starts a session and answers with its id in the header `Mcp-Session-Id`, which the client sends with every request after that; MCP clients do this on their own. `DELETE /mcp` ends the session, and so do 30 minutes without requests. Requests of a session that ended get `404`, and the client starts a new one with `initialize`. There is no stream of server-initiated messages yet, so `GET /mcp` answers `405`.

`gnubase --help` lists every option. Exit codes: 0 done, 1 unexpected error, 2 invalid command line, 3 the audio device or the project could not be set up.

## Connecting clients

### Claude Code

stdio, with GNUbase started by Claude Code; everything after `--` is GNUbase's command line:

```bash
claude mcp add gnubase -- /path/to/gnubase --headless
claude mcp add gnubase -- /path/to/gnubase --headless --project /path/to/song.dawproject
```

HTTP, to a GNUbase that already runs with `--mcp-http`; use the URL and the token it printed:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http gnubase http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

The token changes every time GNUbase starts, so stdio is simpler for everyday use. `claude mcp list` shows whether Claude Code can reach the server, and `/mcp` inside Claude Code shows its status and tools. `--scope project` stores the server in the project's `.mcp.json`, to share it with a team; `--scope user` makes it available in all your projects.

### Other clients

Most MCP clients take a JSON configuration with an `mcpServers` entry. For stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gnubase": {
      "command": "/path/to/gnubase",
      "args": ["--headless"]
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gnubase": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}
    }
  }
}
```

A client that only speaks stdio can still use GNUbase: that is the default. A client that only speaks HTTP needs `--mcp-http`.

## Example session

A session over stdio, as the client sends it and GNUbase answers (long results shortened with `…`). The client starts with `initialize`:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"example","version":"1"}}}
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"capabilities":{"resources":{"listChanged":false,"subscribe":false},"tools":{"listChanged":false}},"instructions":"GNUbase is a digital audio workstation. Every tool runs one engine command; tools marked read-only only read. engine_commands lists every command with its documentation.","protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","serverInfo":{"name":"gnubase","title":"GNUbase","version":"0.1.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
```

A tool that changes the project, `track_add`. The result comes as text and as `structuredContent`:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"track_add","arguments":{"type":"audio"}}}
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[{"text":"…","type":"text"}],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{"channel":{"channels":2,"id":4,"input":1,"output":2,"track":3},"track":{"channel":4,"color":null,"id":3,"name":"Audio 01","parent":0,"timeBase":"musical","type":"audio"}}}}
```

Play a 1 kHz sine on the device input through the new audio track, rendered offline:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"audio_setDevice","arguments":{"input":{"processor":"sine","parameters":{"Frequency":1000}}}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"audio_render","arguments":{"frames":48000}}}
{"id":4,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[…],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{"capturedFrames":48000,"device":{"backend":"dummy",…},"droppedFrames":0,"playbackDropouts":0,"position":48000,"running":false}}}
```

Measure what was rendered: levels in dBFS, the strongest frequency and octave bands, and the loudness in LUFS:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"audio_analyze","arguments":{"channels":[0],"peaks":1}}}
{"id":5,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[…],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{"channels":[{"channel":0,"peak":0.5,"peakDb":-6.020599913279624,"rms":0.35355338722797996,"rmsDb":-9.030899952595973,"spectrum":{"bands":[…],"peaks":[{"frequency":999.9819858148717,"level":-6.020600003146717}]}}],"frames":48000,"loudness":-9.024238371036198,"sampleRate":48000.0,"start":0}}}
```

Or check it with a Lua test case in `script_run`; a failing case would come back with `isError` and the file and line:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":6,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"script_run","arguments":{"name":"level.lua","code":"local test = gnubase.test\ntest.case('the output plays the sine', function()\n\tlocal peak = 0\n\tfor _, s in ipairs(gnubase.audio.capture{channel = 0, start = 0, frames = 4800}.samples) do\n\t\tpeak = math.max(peak, math.abs(s))\n\tend\n\ttest.near(peak, 0.5, 0.01)\nend)"}}}
{"id":6,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[…],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{"output":"1..1\nok 1 - the output plays the sine\n"}}}
```

Read a query as a resource:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":7,"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"gnubase://transport.get"}}
{"id":7,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"contents":[{"mimeType":"application/json","text":"{\"cycle\":false,\"left\":0,\"playing\":false,\"position\":0,\"returnToStart\":false,\"right\":0,\"startMode\":\"cursor\"}","uri":"gnubase://transport.get"}]}}
```

A command that fails tells the agent why:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":8,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"track_add","arguments":{"type":"nonsense"}}}
{"id":8,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[{"text":"parameters.type must be one of [\"audio\",\"instrument\",\"midi\",\"folder\",\"group\",\"effect\"]","type":"text"}],"isError":true}}
```

Over HTTP, the same messages go one per request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"engine_version"}}'
```

Only `events_take` needs a session: send `initialize` first (`curl -i` shows the `Mcp-Session-Id` header of the answer) and then the header `Mcp-Session-Id: <id>` with every request.

## Events

Every session has a queue of the engine events since it started: what changed in the project, the transport, the audio device and the undo history, with the same names and data as in Lua ([lua.md](lua.md#events)). The events come from every client of the engine: this MCP client, other MCP clients, Lua scripts (those run with `script_run` too) and the UI. Over stdio, the whole input is one session; over HTTP, `initialize` starts a session for each client.

`events_take` takes the events that haven't been taken yet, oldest first. The events of a command are there as soon as its result is. Each event has its `name`, its `data` and `request`, the engine's id for the command that caused it, the same for all events of one command:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"track_add","arguments":{"type":"audio"}}}
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[…],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{…}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"events_take"}}
{"id":3,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[…],"isError":false,"structuredContent":{"dropped":0,"events":[{"data":{"channel":{…},"track":{"channel":4,"color":null,"id":3,"name":"Audio 01","parent":0,"timeBase":"musical","type":"audio"}},"name":"track.added","request":2},{"data":{"position":1,"redo":null,"steps":1,"undo":"Add track"},"name":"history.changed","request":2}]}}}
```

- `names` takes only the events with these names, e.g. `{"names":["track.added","track.removed"]}`. The others stay queued for later calls.
- `seconds` waits up to that long, at most 60, for the first event, and returns as soon as one arrives, e.g. to wait for a change someone makes in the UI. Without it, `events_take` returns at once.
- A session keeps the newest 1000 events. `dropped` counts the older ones that were dropped since the last call. Events were missed then, and queries such as `project_get` or `transport_get` tell the current state.

GNUbase doesn't push events to clients yet (MCP notifications over stdio, the HTTP stream, resource subscriptions): many clients don't pass them on to the model, while a tool works with every client.

## Security

The MCP server gives a client the same power over GNUbase as the person using it, and it is built so that only the intended client gets it:

- **stdio** talks only to the process that started GNUbase. Whoever can start a program as you can already do what GNUbase does.
- **HTTP listens on 127.0.0.1 only.** Requests from other addresses are refused (`403`), so the server can't be reached from the network.
- **Every HTTP request needs the access token** (`401` without it). The token is 32 random bytes from the operating system's random source, new on every start, and compared in constant time. Other users and programs on the machine can't use the server without it.
- **Web pages can't use it.** Browsers send an `Origin` header; requests from pages of other origins are refused (`403`), which stops DNS rebinding attacks, where a web page reaches a local server through a name that resolves to 127.0.0.1.
- **Tools act with your rights.** Some tools read and write files wherever you can, such as `project_load`, `project_save`, `media_add`, `media_convert`, `audio_record` and `audio_compare`. Only connect agents you trust with your files, and review what they do, as with any tool that edits files.
- **`script_run` is sandboxed:** Lua without files, processes or bytecode (no `io`, `os`, `debug`, `package`, `require`, `dofile` or `loadfile`), and at most 60 seconds of Lua code per call. Scripts that come with a project never run without your consent.

## Troubleshooting

| What happens | Why, and what to do |
|---|---|
| The client can't start GNUbase, or `claude mcp list` shows it failed | The path is wrong or misses `--headless`. Run the same command in a terminal: it should wait for input. Exit code 2 means an invalid option (`gnubase --help`), 3 that the audio device or `--project` could not be set up; stderr says which. |
| The client gets text that isn't JSON over stdio | Something else wrote to stdout, such as a wrapper script. GNUbase itself only writes MCP messages there. |
| `401 Unauthorized` over HTTP | The token is missing or old: it changes every time GNUbase starts. Use the one it printed last, as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| `403 Forbidden` over HTTP | The request came from another machine or a web page. Connect from this machine, to `127.0.0.1`, without a browser. |
| `404 Not Found` over HTTP | The session ended: the client ended it, it had no requests for 30 minutes, or GNUbase started again. MCP clients start a new session with `initialize` on their own; the events of the old one are gone. |
| `events_take` says it needs a session | The request had no `Mcp-Session-Id` header. Send `initialize` first, then its session id with every request. |
| `405 Method Not Allowed` | The client opened `GET /mcp` for server-initiated messages, which GNUbase doesn't send yet. Clients fall back to POST. |
| A tool result has `isError: true` | The command failed, and the text says why; nothing changed. `engine_commands` describes every command. |
| This catalogue misses a tool | It's generated from the server; the tests fail when it's out of date. Run them with `GNUBASE_UPDATE_DOCS=1` and commit `docs/mcp.md`. |

## Tool catalogue

Generated from what the MCP server lists, with `script_run`: every tool by area, its engine command, whether it only reads, its arguments and its result. The tests fail when it is out of date; running them with `GNUBASE_UPDATE_DOCS=1` writes it again.

<!-- Generated from the MCP server's tools/list: run the tests with GNUBASE_UPDATE_DOCS=1 to update it. -->

### audioEvent

#### `audioEvent_add`

Engine command `audioEvent.add`.

Adds an audio event that plays a section of a clip on an audio track. position is in the track's time base (ticks or samples); offset and length are in the clip's sample frames, length defaulting to the rest of the clip. volume is in dB, from -144 to 6 (default 0); a muted event doesn't play. A track plays one event at a time: where events overlap, the one added last plays, unless they crossfade.

Arguments:

- `clip`: integer, required
- `length`: integer
- `mute`: boolean
- `offset`: integer
- `position`: integer, required
- `track`: integer, required
- `volume`: number

Result:

- `event`: object, required

#### `audioEvent_remove`

Engine command `audioEvent.remove`.

Removes an audio event.

Arguments:

- `event`: integer, required

#### `audioEvent_set`

Engine command `audioEvent.set`.

Changes an audio event's position, clip, offset, length, volume (dB) or mute.

Arguments:

- `clip`: integer
- `event`: integer, required
- `length`: integer
- `mute`: boolean
- `offset`: integer
- `position`: integer
- `volume`: number

Result:

- `event`: object, required

#### `audioEvent_setFades`

Engine command `audioEvent.setFades`.

Changes an audio event's fade in (from its start) or fade out (up to its end): length in the clip's sample frames (0: none) and shape: linear, exponential (slow, then fast), logarithmic (fast, then slow), sCurve (half a cosine) or equalPower (a quarter sine). Together they fit into the event. A crossfade replaces the fades at the ends it joins while it plays.

Arguments:

- `event`: integer, required
- `fadeIn`: object
- `fadeOut`: object

Result:

- `event`: object, required

### audio

#### `audio_analyze`

Engine command `audio.analyze`. Read-only.

Measures the captured output of channels (default: every output) from frame start for frames frames (default: to the end of the capture). Per channel: the peak and RMS level, and a spectrum summary with the strongest frequencies (at most peaks, default 5, up to 20) and the power of octave bands. For the channels together: the integrated loudness in LUFS (ITU-R BS.1770), null below 400 ms. Levels are linear and in dBFS (a full-scale sine's peak is 0 dBFS, its RMS -3 dBFS); dBFS is null for silence.

Arguments:

- `channels`: array of integer
- `frames`: integer
- `peaks`: integer
- `start`: integer

Result:

- `channels`: array of object, required

Engine command `audio.capture`. Read-only.

Captured output samples of one output channel of the dummy device, from frame start, at most 1048576 frames.

Arguments:

- `channel`: integer, required
- `frames`: integer, required
- `start`: integer, required

Result:

- `samples`: array, required

#### `audio_compare`

Engine command `audio.compare`. Read-only.

Null test: subtracts an audio file, reference, from the captured output and measures what remains. The file's channels are compared with channels (default: every output) in order, from frame start, for frames frames (default: the file's length); its sample rate must be the device's. peak is the largest difference of all channels, 0 if they cancel completely.

Arguments:

#### `audio_devices`

Engine command `audio.devices`. Read-only.

The audio backends of this build, the preferred one first, and the devices each has now: their ids, names, channel names, sample rates, block sizes, clock sources (and the current one), whether the driver has a control panel, and whether the device is available. An unavailable device, e.g. one whose hardware isn't connected, has an unavailableReason; audio.setDevice still tries it. Some backends only learn that by opening or starting the device (ASIO). A backend that can't list its devices has an error instead.

Result:

- `backends`: array, required

#### `audio_get`

Engine command `audio.get`. Read-only.

The audio device (its backend, id, name, format, channel names, latencies in frames, clock source and whether it has a control panel), whether it runs, how many frames it has processed and, if it is the dummy device, captured, how many frames of audio track playback were silent because a disk stream was late, and the processing threads (see audio.setProcessing).

Result:

- `capturedFrames`: integer, required
- `device`: object or null, required
- `droppedFrames`: integer, required
- `playbackDropouts`: integer, required
- `position`: integer, required
- `processing`: object, required
- `running`: boolean, required

#### `audio_performance`

Engine command `audio.performance`. Read-only.

Performance data for the performance monitor. Loads are the share of a block's duration spent processing it, so above 1 the device drops out. load: averaged over about 0.3 s; peak: the highest block; overloads: blocks above 1; cycles: blocks measured; threads: the load of each processing thread, the audio thread first. Peak, overloads and cycles count since the last audio.resetPerformance; everything starts over with a new device or new processing threads. diskLoad: how far the disk stream furthest behind has run empty, 0 to 1; diskDropouts: frames of audio track playback that were silent because a disk stream was late.

Writes the captured output of channels (default: every output) from frame start for frames frames (default: to the end of the capture) to a WAV file at path, with samples in format (default float32). Returns the file's absolute path.

Arguments:

- `channels`: array of integer
- `format`: one of "float32" | "int16" | "int24" | "int32"
- `frames`: integer
- `path`: string, required
- `start`: integer

Result:

- `frames`: integer, required
- `path`: string, required

- `running`: boolean, required

#### `audio_reset`

Engine command `audio.reset`.

Opens the audio device again with the same settings and restarts it if it ran. Drivers ask for this when their settings change, e.g. in their control panel; the engine then resets on its own.

Result:

- `capturedFrames`: integer, required
- `device`: object or null, required
- `droppedFrames`: integer, required
- `playbackDropouts`: integer, required
- `position`: integer, required
- `processing`: object, required
- `running`: boolean, required

#### `audio_resetPerformance`

Engine command `audio.resetPerformance`.

Starts a new performance measurement, like clicking the overload indicator: clears the peak, the overloads and the cycles; the averaged loads go on. Immediately while the device is stopped, otherwise with its next block. Returns the measurement that ended, as audio.performance does, and sends it as the event audio.performanceReset.

Result:

- `cycles`: integer, required
- `diskDropouts`: integer, required
- `diskLoad`: number, required
- `load`: number, required
- `overloads`: integer, required
- `peak`: number, required
- `threads`: array of number, required

#### `audio_setDevice`

Engine command `audio.setDevice`.

Replaces the audio device. backend: one from audio.devices, by default "dummy". device: its id, by default the backend's default device. sampleRate and blockSize: by default the driver's current rate and preferred size. clockSource: a name from the device's clockSources. The device starts stopped at position 0. Another backend's device is closed before the new one opens, since drivers often allow only one; if opening fails, there is no device.
The dummy device has no hardware: its output is captured in memory (audio.capture) and it renders offline (audio.render). Its defaults: 48000 Hz, blocks of 256 frames, 2 inputs, 2 outputs (inputChannels, outputChannels), 60 s of capture (captureSeconds). Its input is silent, or a built-in generator (see processor.list) with parameters by name.

Arguments:

- `droppedFrames`: integer, required
- `playbackDropouts`: integer, required
- `position`: integer, required
- `processing`: object, required
- `running`: boolean, required

#### `audio_setProcessing`

Engine command `audio.setProcessing`.

Multi-processing: threads is how many threads process the graph, the audio thread included (1 to 64; default: half the hardware threads, about one per core). Independent tracks then run in parallel; the output is the same for any number of threads. The device must be stopped. activeThreads in the result is how many process, and limitedBy why that is fewer: multiProcessing is off, the hardware has fewer threads, worker threads didn't get real-time priority (on Linux: no real-time privileges), or the system refused to start them (system). Fails, keeping the previous settings, if threads can't be started.

Arguments:

- `multiProcessing`: boolean
- `threads`: integer

Result:

Engine command `audio.start`.

Simulated real time: the device processes one block per block duration until stopped.

Result:

- `capturedFrames`: integer, required
- `device`: object or null, required
- `droppedFrames`: integer, required
- `playbackDropouts`: integer, required
- `position`: integer, required
- `processing`: object, required
- `running`: boolean, required

#### `audio_stop`

Stops simulated real time. Does nothing if the device isn't running.

Result:

- `device`: object or null, required
- `droppedFrames`: integer, required
- `playbackDropouts`: integer, required
- `position`: integer, required
- `processing`: object, required
- `running`: boolean, required

### autoFades

#### `autoFades_set`

Engine command `autoFades.set`.

Changes the auto fades and crossfades of the project, or of an audio track: fadeIn and fadeOut where an event has no fade of its own at that end (they never stack), crossfades where an event starts on top of another one or ends above one that goes on, unless they crossfade already; there an event's own fade is the crossfade's, mirrored by the event behind. length is 1 to 500 ms; shapes as for audioEvent.setFades; crossfadeMode equalGain or equalPower, with crossfadeShape the fade in as for crossfade.set. A track uses the project's settings until it gets its own; useProject: true goes back to them. Returns the settings that apply.

Arguments:

- `crossfadeMode`: one of "equalGain" | "equalPower" | "custom"
- `crossfadeShape`: one of "linear" | "exponential" | "logarithmic" | "sCurve" | "equalPower"
- `crossfades`: boolean

Adds an automation lane to a track: the curve of one parameter. target.type says which: volume (the channel's fader, in dB), pan, panLeft and panRight (-1 to 1, see channel.set) on tracks with audio channels; instrument, a parameter of an instrument track's built-in instrument (target.parameter, an id from processor.list, in its range); controller (target.number 0-127), pitchBend (0.5 is no bend) and channelPressure, all 0 to 1, on MIDI and instrument tracks, with target.channel 0-15 (default 0). A track has one lane per target. read (default true): the curve plays; without it, or without points, the parameter keeps its static value.

Arguments:

- `target`: object, required
- `track`: integer, required

Result:

### automationPoint

#### `automationPoint_add`

Engine command `automationPoint.add`.

Adds points to an automation lane: position in the track's time base (ticks on musical tracks, so automation follows tempo changes; samples on linear ones, so it keeps its time), value in the target's unit, shape of the curve to the next point (step, linear or curve; default linear) and for curves the bend, curve, from -1 to 1 (above 0 the value moves fast at first). Before the first point the curve has its value, after the last point the last one's; points at one position make a jump. A ramp of volume moves the gain in a straight line.

Arguments:

- `lane`: integer, required
- `points`: array of object, required

Result:

- `points`: array, required

#### `automationPoint_remove`

Engine command `automationPoint.remove`.

Arguments:

- `lane`: integer, required
- `points`: array of object, required

Result:

- `points`: array, required

### automation

#### `automation_get`

Engine command `automation.get`. Read-only.

Result:

- `followsEvents`: boolean, required

#### `automation_set`

Engine command `automation.set`.

Changes the automation settings (see automation.get). A setting, so it stays when a new project starts.

Arguments:

- `followsEvents`: boolean

Result:

- `followsEvents`: boolean, required

### bus

#### `bus_add`

Engine command `bus.add`.

Adds an input or output bus. format is its speaker arrangement (default stereo): mono, stereo, or a surround format with a fixed speaker order, e.g. 5.1 as L R C LFE Ls Rs. channels (1 to 8) picks mono, stereo, LRC, quadro, 5.0, 5.1, 7.0 or 7.1 instead.

Arguments:

- `channels`: integer
- `direction`: one of "input" | "output", required
- `format`: one of "mono" | "stereo" | "LRC" | "LRS" | "LRC+LFE" | "LRS+LFE" | "LRCS" | "LRCS+LFE" | "quadro" | "quadro+LFE" | "5.0" | "5.1" | "6.0 cine" | "6.0 music" | "7.0" | "7.1"
- `name`: string, required

Result:

- `bus`: object, required

#### `bus_remove`

Engine command `bus.remove`.

Removes a bus; channels connected to it are disconnected.

Arguments:

- `bus`: integer, required

#### `bus_set`

Engine command `bus.set`.

Renames a bus.

Arguments:

- `bus`: integer, required
- `name`: string

Result:

- `bus`: object, required

### channel

#### `channel_set`

Engine command `channel.set`.

Changes a channel's format (or channels, as in bus.add), input (an input bus) or output (an output bus or a group channel; for MIDI tracks an instrument channel). 0 disconnects. Audio converts between formats where a channel feeds a destination of another one: speakers both formats have connect, the others are mixed down (5.1 to stereo: C and LFE into L and R at -3 dB, Ls into L and Rs into R at -6 dB; 7.1 to 5.1: Sl and Sr into the front and surround sides at -3 dB) or up (mono to C, or to L and R at the pan law's center). instrument is the built-in instrument an instrument track plays (see processor.list), or empty for none. volume is the fader in dB, from -144 (silence) to the project's maxVolume (default 0); values beyond them stop there. The panner depends on the routing: a mono channel on a stereo destination has its position pan, -1 (left) to 1 (right), placed with the project's pan law; a stereo channel on a stereo or mono destination has the balance panner (panner balance, the default: pan turns down the other side) or the combined panner (panner combined: panLeft and panRight place its left and right channel, by default -1 and 1). panBypass plays mono channels at the center and stereo ones hard left and right. Destinations wider than stereo have no panner yet. Automation of volume, pan, panLeft and panRight overrides them while it plays; changes glide over 5 ms. MIDI channels have no audio: midiVolume and midiPan (0 to 127, 64 is the center pan, null for none, the default) are sent to the instrument as MIDI volume (CC 7) and pan (CC 10) on MIDI channel 1, whenever they change and when playback starts or jumps; automation of those controllers overrides them.

Arguments:

- `channel`: integer, required
- `channels`: integer
- `format`: one of "mono" | "stereo" | "LRC" | "LRS" | "LRC+LFE" | "LRS+LFE" | "LRCS" | "LRCS+LFE" | "quadro" | "quadro+LFE" | "5.0" | "5.1" | "6.0 cine" | "6.0 music" | "7.0" | "7.1"
- `input`: integer
- `instrument`: string
- `midiPan`: integer or null
- `midiVolume`: integer or null
- `output`: integer
- `pan`: number
- `panBypass`: boolean

Changes controller events of a MIDI part: each change names a controller event by id and gives what changes: position in ticks, type, and the fields of the type as controller.add takes them (number, value, channel, bank, data). A field the type doesn't have is an error, such as value on a program change; a null bank removes it. A new type keeps the fields it shares with the old one and needs the others. Returns the changed controller events.

#### `crossfade_set`

Engine command `crossfade.set`.

Crossfades from an audio event into the next one on its track, where they overlap: to must start inside from and end after it. Both play there; from fades out up to its end over outLength (from's clip frames), to fades in from its start over length (to's clip frames); 0, the default, is the whole overlap, so the crossfade is symmetric. mode equalGain (default): the fade out mirrors the fade in (shape linear, exponential, logarithmic or sCurve), so their gains add up to 1; equalPower: quarter sines whose power adds up to 1; custom: shape and outShape of their own. An event fades out into one event only. Changing a crossfade keeps what isn't given. After an edit that moves the events apart, the crossfade rests and both play their own fades until they overlap like that again. Returns to.

Arguments:

- `from`: integer, required
- `length`: integer
- `mode`: one of "equalGain" | "equalPower" | "custom"

### media

#### `media_add`

Engine command `media.add`.

Adds an audio file. Its sample rate, channel count and length in sample frames are read from the file, or taken as given, for a file that is still being recorded. With copy, a file from outside the project folder is also copied into its media folder (see project.location); the project must have been saved. The copy runs as a job, returned as job (null without one), with the result that media.prepareArchive's job has: the media file is added at once where it is, and when the copy is done it is pointed at the copy as an undo step of its own.

Arguments:

- `length`: integer
- `path`: string, required
- `sampleRate`: number

Result:

- `job`: object or null, required

- `sampleRate`: number

Result:

Peak files are kept next to their audio file as <file name>.gbpeaks, or in fallbackFolder where that can't be written.

Arguments:

- `media`: integer

Result:

- `fallbackFolder`: string, required
- `media`: array of object, required

#### `media_peaks`

Engine command `media.peaks`. Read-only.

The waveform overview of a media file for drawing: frames sample frames of the file from start (default: the rest of the file), in pixels columns (up to 65536). Per channel (default: all of them; channels picks some, numbered from 0), the smallest and largest sample of each column, from -32767 to 32767 (full scale). Pixels times channels can be up to 262144. The columns come from the coarsest level of the file's peaks (level: 256, 4096 or 65536 frames per peak) that has a peak per column, so they cost the same at any length. status says whether the peaks are ready; while they are generated, only the first available frames have columns and the rest are 0. A file that changed since its peaks were made gets new ones; media.peaksProgress and media.peaksReady report how that goes.

Arguments:

- `channels`: array of integer
- `frames`: integer
- `media`: integer, required
- `pixels`: integer, required
- `start`: integer

Result:

#### `media_prepareArchive`

Engine command `media.prepareArchive`.

Makes the project self-contained, so that its folder can be archived or moved: copies every media file from outside the project folder into its media folder and points the media at the copies. The copies run as a job: this returns at once, job.progress and job.finished events follow, and job.cancel stops it and removes the copies. Once they are done, the media are pointed at them as one undo step. The job's result lists the copies as copied, media files that couldn't be read as missing (they keep their paths), and media whose path changed while the job ran as changed (they keep the new path). The project must have been saved; save it again without embedding media to keep the new paths.

Result:

- `job`: object, required

#### `media_relink`

Engine command `media.relink`.

Points media files at other files, such as copies, as one undo step. Each new file must be an audio file with the media file's sample rate and channel count.

Result:

- `relinked`: array of integer, required
- `skipped`: array of integer, required

#### `media_remove`

Engine command `media.stretch`.

Time-stretches and pitch-shifts a media file, writes the result to path as a 32-bit float WAV file and adds it as a new media file; path must not be one of the project's media files. ratio is the new length over the old one, from 0.1 to 10 (default 1: unchanged); semitones and cents shift the pitch, together within 48 semitones either way (default 0). preset picks the algorithm: quality (default) and efficient for any material, drums, plucked, pads, vocals, mix and solo tuned for kinds of material at a lower CPU cost. formants keeps the spectral envelope when the pitch shifts, e.g. for voices. mode offline (default) analyzes the whole file first for the best result; realtime processes it the way playback does, with ratios from 0.25 to 4 and pitch shifts within 24 semitones.

Arguments:

- `cents`: number
- `formants`: boolean
- `media`: integer, required
- `mode`: one of "realtime" | "offline"

The file has the notes and controllers as they play, converted to MIDI 1.0, the track names, tempo and time signatures, and the markers unless markers is false. A note ends where the next note of its pitch and channel starts, so that overlapping notes read back the same. range {start, end} in ticks exports only what starts in it, moved to the file's start. Returns the number of tracks in the file.

Arguments:

- `markers`: boolean
- `path`: string, required
- `ppq`: integer

Imports a standard MIDI file (type 0, 1 or 2) into new MIDI tracks (trackType midi, the default) or instrument tracks, one part per track from the bar of its first event to the bar after its last. A type 0 file gets a track per MIDI channel; the sequences of a type 2 file are laid out one after another, each from a bar start. Names that aren't UTF-8 are read as Windows-1252. Unless tempo is false, the file's tempo and time signatures replace the project's; unless markers is false, its markers are added to the active marker track (one is added if there is none). One undo step. Returns the new tracks and parts.

Reports the plugins that failed since the last check because their host process crashed, missed a processing deadline (reason "hung") or broke the protocol, and emits plugin.failed for each with its instance, plugin id, process and reason. A failed plugin is bypassed and outputs silence. Also emits pluginhost.changed for each hosting mode change whose moves are done. The engine runs this on its own as soon as a failure is detected or the moves are done.

Result:

- `failures`: array of object, required

#### `pluginhost_get`

Engine command `pluginhost.get`. Read-only.

How plugins are grouped into plugin host processes, and the processes. mode: the hosting mode, "shared" (one process for every plugin), "perVendor", "perPlugin" or "perInstance"; defaultMode: the mode GNUbase starts with; overrides: plugin ids with a mode of their own. hosts: each process with its id (process), its group ("shared", "vendor:<vendor>", "plugin:<id>" or "instance:<instance>"), its state ("running", "hung" or "exited") and its plugin instances, whether they failed.

Result:

- `hosts`: array of object, required
- `mode`: string, required
- `overrides`: object, required

Plugins whose process changes then move to their new process in the background, with their state, between two blocks, so they keep sounding the same. When they did, pluginhost.changed is emitted with the new status, and with the plugins that could not move and stay where they are in errors.

Arguments:

- `mode`: one of "shared" | "perVendor" | "perPlugin" | "perInstance", required

Result:

- `defaultMode`: string, required
- `errors`: array of string

### project

#### `project_backup`

Engine command `project.backup`.

Backs the project up as it is now into folder, which must be empty or new: the project file, named name (by default after the project file, or else the project), and copies of its media in the folder Audio, which the project file refers to relative to itself, so that the folder opens on another machine. The project itself stays as it is. minimize keeps only the ranges of audio files that audio events play, with handles seconds (default 1) before and after; removeUnused leaves out clips that no audio event uses and media that no clip uses. currentVersionsOnly and skipVideo have no effect until clips have versions and projects have video. activate opens the backup once it is done, unless the project changed meanwhile. The backup runs as a job: this returns at once, job.progress and job.finished events follow, and job.cancel stops it and removes what it wrote. A folder that a running job writes into can't be used. The job's result is {file, files, missing, activated, activationError}: missing lists the media files that couldn't be read and keep their old paths; activated says whether the backup was opened, and activationError why not, if it was asked to be.

Arguments:

Arguments:

- `mediaFolder`: string
- `path`: string, required
- `revision`: integer

#### `project_location`

Engine command `project.location`. Read-only.

Where the project is: its project file (set by project.save and project.load), the folder of that file, and the media folder in it where media.add with copy and media.prepareArchive put audio files. All null for a project that has no file yet.

Result:

- `revision`: integer, required

#### `project_save`

#### `project_set`

Engine command `project.set`.

Changes the project's name, sample rate, stereo pan law or maximum volume. Linear positions keep their time at a new sample rate. panLaw is how much a mono channel panned to the center is turned down on each side: 0dB, -3dB (the default), -4.5dB, -6dB or equalPower (-3.01 dB, the power stays the same wherever it is panned); the side panned toward is always at 0 dB. maxVolume is the top of the faders, 6 (the default) or 12 dB; faders above a lower maximum come down to it.

Arguments:

- `maxVolume`: number
- `name`: string
- `panLaw`: one of "0dB" | "-3dB" | "-4.5dB" | "-6dB" | "equalPower"

Quantizes note starts: moves them toward the nearest position of the grid, or of the groove, and keeps their lengths. Takes the notes of part (only notes, if given) or of every part in parts. The settings are the project's (see quantize.set), or preset's, changed by settings. Quantizing starts from the notes' original timing unless settings.soft is true, and keeps it, so quantize.reset puts it back. Notes moved by other means since they were quantized start from where they are; velocities and lengths changed by other means stay. Returns the notes that changed.

### Resources

Queries without required arguments can also be read as resources:

- `gnubase://audio.analyze`: Measures the captured output of channels (default: every output) from frame start for frames frames (default: to the end of the capture). Per channel: the peak and RMS level, and a spectrum summary with the strongest frequencies (at most peaks, default 5, up to 20) and the power of octave bands. For the channels together: the integrated loudness in LUFS (ITU-R BS.1770), null below 400 ms. Levels are linear and in dBFS (a full-scale sine's peak is 0 dBFS, its RMS -3 dBFS); dBFS is null for silence.
- `gnubase://audio.devices`: The audio backends of this build, the preferred one first, and the devices each has now: their ids, names, channel names, sample rates, block sizes, clock sources (and the current one), whether the driver has a control panel, and whether the device is available. An unavailable device, e.g. one whose hardware isn't connected, has an unavailableReason; audio.setDevice still tries it. Some backends only learn that by opening or starting the device (ASIO). A backend that can't list its devices has an error instead.
- `gnubase://audio.get`: The audio device (its backend, id, name, format, channel names, latencies in frames, clock source and whether it has a control panel), whether it runs, how many frames it has processed and, if it is the dummy device, captured, how many frames of audio track playback were silent because a disk stream was late, and the processing threads (see audio.setProcessing).
- `gnubase://audio.performance`: Performance data for the performance monitor. Loads are the share of a block's duration spent processing it, so above 1 the device drops out. load: averaged over about 0.3 s; peak: the highest block; overloads: blocks above 1; cycles: blocks measured; threads: the load of each processing thread, the audio thread first. Peak, overloads and cycles count since the last audio.resetPerformance; everything starts over with a new device or new processing threads. diskLoad: how far the disk stream furthest behind has run empty, 0 to 1; diskDropouts: frames of audio track playback that were silent because a disk stream was late.
- `gnubase://automation.get`: The automation settings. followsEvents (default false): when an audio event or MIDI part moves, the automation of its track in its range moves with it and replaces the points where it lands.
- `gnubase://automationLane.list`: The automation lanes of a track, or of every track in track order, with their points sorted by position.
- `gnubase://engine.commandLog`: The last 256 commands that ran, oldest first, without queries: what the UI and other clients did. Each with its request id (events name it too), the client that sent it (ui, mcp, lua, app for the command line, engine for the engine's own commands), the command, its parameters, and the error if it failed.
- `gnubase://engine.commands`: Every command with its documentation, parameters and result.
- `gnubase://engine.version`: The GNUbase version.
- `gnubase://graph.get`: The project's audio processing graph: its nodes (busses, then channels in track order) with the nodes they receive audio and events from, and the order they are processed in.
- `gnubase://history.get`: The undo history: every step with its action, time (UTC) and details, the position (steps before it are done, the ones after it can be redone) and the maximum number of steps (0: no limit).
- `gnubase://job.list`: Every background job since the engine started, such as backups: id, kind, state (running, done, failed or cancelled), progress from 0 to 1, what it is doing, and its result or error once it ended.
- `gnubase://marker.list`: The markers of a marker track (default: the active one; track 0 if there is none) in timeline order, with their position and end also in the project's samples.
- `gnubase://media.peakStatus`: The state of the waveform overviews of a media file, or of every media file: pending, generating (with progress from 0 to 1), ready, failed (with the error) or recording; the frames that have peaks; the peak file they were loaded from or written to; whether they were generated from the audio file rather than loaded. Peak files are kept next to their audio file as <file name>.gbpeaks, or in fallbackFolder where that can't be written.
- `gnubase://midi.monitor`: The MIDI input received since the last call from every open input, at most 4096 messages, each with its port, its frame position on the audio device and its bytes. dropped counts what didn't fit. Input reaches the monitor while an audio device processes blocks, which places it in time.
- `gnubase://midi.ports`: The MIDI ports of every MIDI backend, inputs and outputs: backend, id, system name, the name they are shown as (showAs), whether they are visible, whether an input belongs to all MIDI inputs, whether the port is present now and open, and whether the system speaks MIDI 2.0 with it. Ports that were unplugged stay listed with their settings, not present.
- `gnubase://pluginhost.get`: How plugins are grouped into plugin host processes, and the processes. mode: the hosting mode, "shared" (one process for every plugin), "perVendor", "perPlugin" or "perInstance"; defaultMode: the mode GNUbase starts with; overrides: plugin ids with a mode of their own. hosts: each process with its id (process), its group ("shared", "vendor:<vendor>", "plugin:<id>" or "instance:<instance>"), its state ("running", "hung" or "exited") and its plugin instances, whether they failed.
- `gnubase://processor.list`: Every built-in processor: its id, name, description, whether it is an instrument, and its parameters with their ids, ranges, defaults and units. A stepped parameter takes whole numbers only; its options, if any, name its values from the minimum on.
- `gnubase://project.get`: The whole project: busses, tracks in order, channels, media, clips, events and parts.
- `gnubase://project.location`: Where the project is: its project file (set by project.save and project.load), the folder of that file, and the media folder in it where media.add with copy and media.prepareArchive put audio files. All null for a project that has no file yet.
- `gnubase://project.revision`: A number that grows with every change of the project: every edit, undo and redo, and loading or starting a project. project.load with revision loads only if it hasn't changed.
- `gnubase://quantize.get`: The project's quantize settings and whether auto quantize is on (see quantize.set for the settings).
- `gnubase://quantize.presets`: The quantize presets: the factory presets (straight grids "1/1" to "1/128", triplets such as "1/8 Triplet" and dotted grids such as "1/4 Dotted") and the user's, each with its settings. The user's presets are kept in the settings folder, so they come back when GNUbase starts again: file is where (null if they are kept in memory only), readOnly whether changes are saved (not while the file belongs to a newer GNUbase), and problems what was wrong with it, such as presets that this GNUbase can't read and skips; they stay in the file.
- `gnubase://settings.list`: Every user setting with its key, description, JSON schema, default and value; the settings file, null when settings are kept in memory only; its version; and what happened when it was loaded: the status (inMemory, missing, loaded, migrated, reset or newer), the version the file had, the problems found, where the original file was kept, and whether the file is read-only for this session, so that changes apply but aren't saved (a newer GNUbase's file, or one that couldn't be backed up or locked).
- `gnubase://transport.get`: Whether playback runs, the project cursor in samples, the locators and the modes. After a locate the cursor is where it goes, even before the audio thread has applied it.
